Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day<br>
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth<br>
Some primal paradise<br>
But there you go again, saying everything ends<br>
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone<br>
<br>
<br>
If the end of the world was near<br>
Where would you choose to be?<br>
If there was five more minutes of air<br>
Would you panic and hide<br>
Or run for your life<br>
Or stand here and spend it with me<br>
If we had five more minutes<br>
Would I, could I, make you happy?<br>
<br>
<br>
And we would live again<br>
In the simplest of ways<br>
Living day after day<br>
Like some primal animals<br>
We would love again<br>
Under glorious suns<br>
With the freedom that comes with the truth, mmm<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
If the end of the world was near<br>
Where would you choose to be?<br>
If there was five more minutes of air<br>
Would you panic and hide?<br>
Or run for your life?<br>
Or stand here and spend it with me?<br>
If we had five more minutes<br>
Would I, could I, make you happy?<br>
<br>
<br>
So it finally came to pass<br>
I saw the end of the world<br>
Saw the madness unfold like<br>
Some primal burial<br>
And I looked back upon<br>
Armageddon<br>
And the moment of truth<br>
Between you and me<br>
<br>
<br>
If we had five more minutes of air to breathe<br>
And we cried all through it<br>
But you spent them with me<br>
On our last few drags of air we agreed<br>
I was and you were happy<br>
